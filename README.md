>ðŸ“‹  A template README.md for code accompanying a Machine Learning paper

# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [Learning to Regress Occluded Human Body with Pseudo Surface Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --cfg configs/vit_train.yaml
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on the benchmark of 3DPW and OCHuman, go to the configs/vit_test.yaml ,set the RUN_TEST = True, run:

```eval
python train.py --cfg configs/vit_test.yaml
```

You should obtain results in this table on 3DPW test set:

| Method.            |    MPJPEâ†“       |    PA-MPJPEâ†“   |      PVEâ†“     |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| MPQA w. 3DPW       |     71.6        |      44.8      |      83.4     |


>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [MPQA Pre-trained Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WojbZvLfGFS8OzcRplwPIw2EeRWiGNd_/view?usp=sharing) trained on 3DPW and OCHuman. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [3D  on the benchmark of 3DPW and OCHuman](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
